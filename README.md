By analyzing this dataset and applying data visualization techniques through tableau, my main purpose is to provide insight for taking better organizational strategies to address its problems in the context of primary research question and sub-research questions. 

**Research Questions:** 
What factors/independent variables have a significant impact on the salary of data science job?

**Sub-Research Questions:**

The following are the sub-research questions that support the main research question’s insight
1)	How experience level and salary in the data science job are correlated?
2)	What are the salary trends based on job titles in various countries? 
3)	How does company size have an impact on salary?

By analyzing sub-research questions and primary research questions, we could identify how the factors determine salary level and what would be the organization’s decision-making strategy to solve the problem.
